  <h2> Painting </h2>
  <body>
  <p> My favorite hobby is painting since I first joined art class in 3rd grade. Until then, I did not have much experience in painting. Neither did I realize I had artistic abilities. Yet, after I joined art class, my teacher helped me be creative in art. I've done pencil sketches, acrylic paintings, watercolor paintings and I even drew a portrait of my mother once. Currently, I am learning different forms of Indian art. </p>
